These complaints alleged that Qualcomm and the Samsung entities had infringed upon certain patents related to graphics processing. \n\nIn response, in November 2014, Samsung filed complaints against NVIDIA in the ITC and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. These complaints alleged that NVIDIA had also infringed upon certain patents. \n\nThe ITC is an independent, quasi-judicial federal agency responsible for investigating and determining the impact of imports on U.S. industries. The United States District Court is a federal court system that handles both civil and criminal cases. \n\nThese legal actions, known as litigation, are ongoing and involve multiple parties. Litigation is a legal process where parties present their arguments and evidence to a court or other legal authority in order to resolve a dispute. In this case, the dispute is regarding the alleged patent infringement by both Qualcomm and NVIDIA. \n\nThe outcome of this litigation will have significant implications for both companies and the technology industry as a whole.
